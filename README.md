## Canvas

### Definition

"Added in HTML5, the HTML <canvas> element can be used to draw graphics via scripting in JavaScript. For example, it can be used to draw graphs, make photo compositions, create animations or even do real-time video processing or rendering." by [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)

### Examples
